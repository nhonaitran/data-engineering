# Sparkify Data Engineering Projects for Song Play Analytics

This repo explores different big data technologies for analyzing songs and user
activity data captured by the music streaming app of the ficticious Sparkify startup.

The goal is to examine a number of technologies to a build business intelligence
platform from which the data scientists can easily analyze the songs and user activity
data collected on the app.

## Datasets

The Sparkify music streaming app collects song metadata and user activity on
the app in json log files.  The sample of these log files are stored under */data*
directory.  

### Song Metadata Dataset
The song dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). 
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist 
of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's 
track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
data/song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
data/song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### User Activity Log Dataset
The second database consists of log files in JSON format generated by this 
[event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs 
in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app 
based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. For example, 
here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.
