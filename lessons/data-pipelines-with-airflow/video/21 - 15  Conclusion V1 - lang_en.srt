00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,439
In lesson two, learn about the aspects of data quality and how we

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,025
can use Apache Airflow to ensure that our pipelines have those features.

4
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:12,660
Thank you for joining us for this lesson.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,429
I hope you had a good time and you learned

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,429
a little bit about Apache Airflow and its components,

7
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:21,390
in addition to data pipelines themselves,

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,570
data validation, and graphs and DAGs.
