1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,930
The only change you had to make was to go in here

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,200
and add schedule interval equal '@daily.'

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,815
So, now that you've done that,

4
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:14,964
you would see a similar result to what we saw here the difference being that,

5
00:00:14,964 --> 00:00:18,824
because we have only a single day time delta,

6
00:00:18,824 --> 00:00:21,629
you would still only see one run,

7
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:25,544
but your schedule here should say '@daily.'

8
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:28,185
Again, if you were interested to see the output,

9
00:00:28,184 --> 00:00:31,199
you can click on the "Task" from here if you'd like,

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,784
you can click on "Hello World" task here,

11
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:38,139
and then click on "Log."

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,329
You can see that we printed "Hello world."

13
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,500
Alright. Again, I'm going to ask you guys if you can,

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,804
just make sure that you toggle your DAGS off when you're done using them.

15
00:00:50,804 --> 00:00:54,719
In a normal airflow installation you would not toggle your DAGS off,

16
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,060
but I just want to make sure that for your exercises,

17
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,420
things are as simple as possible,

18
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,609
so that you're getting the most out of those exercises.
