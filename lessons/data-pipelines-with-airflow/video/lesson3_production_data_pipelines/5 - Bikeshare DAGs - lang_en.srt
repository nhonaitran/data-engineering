1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,415
All right. So, let's visualize our Bikeshare analysis process from earlier as a DAG.

2
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:11,129
First, we're going to extract the data from S3 and load the data from S3 into Redshift.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:17,115
So, I've represented that process as this light blue circle here, S3 to Redshift.

4
00:00:17,114 --> 00:00:22,664
Then, we're going to perform analysis in Redshift using SQL.

5
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:26,669
Finally, we might deliver our data to some destination server.

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,490
So, these are three discrete steps,

7
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:32,070
which we've represented here with the node,

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,340
we have an edge or relationship to another node.

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,885
So, as time goes on,

10
00:00:36,884 --> 00:00:40,949
it's not uncommon to need to modify or add new data sources to our data pipelines.

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,915
Let's say we decide to integrate additional data about traffic from the city.

12
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:47,869
We might hypothesize that high traffic areas

13
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:51,049
are also places where we would like to place Bikeshare locations.

14
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:54,640
You now want to incorporate that information into your Redshift analysis.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,960
To access this data,

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,590
you will need to extract the data from

17
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,925
the city's API and load it into a table and Redshift for analysis.

18
00:01:01,924 --> 00:01:06,125
The step will need to be completed before we perform Redshift analysis.

19
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,870
So, in this diagram,

20
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:13,189
you can see here we've added another task and another edge to a Redshift analysis,

21
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:16,280
and this task is HTTP to Redshift.

22
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,290
So, we can just imagine here that we're talking to

23
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,390
the city's data API to get traffic information and then loading it to Redshift.
