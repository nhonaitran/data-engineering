00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,169
You guys already saw the solution to this but real quick,

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:07,229
I'm going to walk through one more time what we did.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,765
So we had these four functions defined.

4
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:12,644
Your functions are slightly different to mine.

5
00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:16,155
But then, we defined three Python operators,

6
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:19,770
and these three operators are for

7
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,160
all intents and purposes the same as our Hello World task,

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,760
but we gave them different IDs and different Python callables.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,765
Then, down here, we configured our DAG

10
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:35,100
using the task dependency ordering operations down here.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,250
So they just needed these double [inaudible].

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,195
So we said Hello World task comes before Current Time task and Working Directory task.

13
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:45,390
Then, when Current Time task and Working Directory task are complete,

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,399
we can run the complete task.

15
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,405
Then, the output that we saw in the UI is very similar to this.

16
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:57,545
We have these four tasks that are complete,

17
00:00:57,545 --> 00:01:02,310
and we can go to Tree View and see a history of our runs.
