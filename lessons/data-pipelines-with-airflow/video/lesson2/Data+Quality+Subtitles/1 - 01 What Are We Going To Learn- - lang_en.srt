1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,235
In this lesson, we'll be covering

2
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:05,565
new concepts and expanding on a few we covered in lesson one.

3
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:08,760
Students will learn what data lineage is and why it's

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,045
critical to defining and maintaining your data pipelines.

5
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,040
Next, we'll go in depth on

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,870
data pipeline schedules and learn how to

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,690
leverage them to make our pipelines more manageable.

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,545
The handle on schedules will be ready to dive in on data partitioning

9
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:26,535
and see how partitioning can make our pipelines faster and more reliable.

10
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:31,035
We'll conclude this lesson with an overview of data quality, how it's defined,

11
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:33,480
and how we can build and test to our data pipelines to

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,400
ensure that our data pipelines are working as intended.
