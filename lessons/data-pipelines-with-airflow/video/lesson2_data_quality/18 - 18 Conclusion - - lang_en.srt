00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,465
I hope you enjoyed our review of the facets of data quality.

2
00:00:03,465 --> 00:00:06,090
Today, we covered data lineage and how we can use it

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,565
to understand the movement of data in our pipelines.

4
00:00:08,565 --> 00:00:11,130
We also covered scheduling and how it can be used

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,965
to speed up our analyses and backfill data.

6
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:17,470
Building on the concepts of using scheduling to speed up analysis,

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,990
we learned how to partition data.

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,700
Finally, you saw the role that

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,925
good requirements play in determining and measuring data quality.

10
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:27,285
In lesson three, we'll build on the concepts from lesson one and two,

11
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:30,400
to learn how to build production quality data pipelines.
