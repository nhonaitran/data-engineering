00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
Hopefully everybody had a good time working in exercise two.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,085
I'm going to review the solution with you real quick.

3
00:00:05,085 --> 00:00:09,180
So, we already saw in my demonstration,

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,385
how to add a monthly interval.

5
00:00:11,385 --> 00:00:14,130
Major difference between the exercise and what I

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,135
demonstrated was the frequency of the runs and how long it was running for.

7
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:19,515
So, I'm going to go ahead,

8
00:00:19,515 --> 00:00:20,910
move back to the code.

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,530
I'm going to pull up the solution here.

10
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,055
So, we're looking at lesson two, exercise two.

11
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:29,025
Okay. So, in the code,

12
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:32,490
I asked for you to set an end date, February first.

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,375
So, your code should look something like this, February one.

14
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:39,315
Secondly, I asked for a schedule interval of monthly,

15
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:42,345
and I wanted to use at the max active runs to one.

16
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:46,930
Once you've done that, very similar to what you saw me show in the Airflow UI,

17
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,130
you would have pulled up the Airflow UI.

18
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,915
Seen lesson two, exercise two,

19
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:54,585
you would've turned it on.

20
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:56,205
Without clicking the run button,

21
00:00:56,205 --> 00:00:57,525
you didn't need to click this.

22
00:00:57,525 --> 00:01:02,045
Airflow automatically would have backfilled for both January and February.

23
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:06,775
You could click into the DAG and you can see a couple of columns here.

24
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:11,775
Click into the graph view and you can see a graph of those runs.

25
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:13,655
Now, it's worth mentioning.

26
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:16,070
If you didn't want to just run through February,

27
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,160
if you wanted to run through the end of 2018 or even to today,

28
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,280
you're more than welcome to do that.

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,855
For the sake of speed,

30
00:01:22,855 --> 00:01:24,710
we had you only do a couple of backfills,

31
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,150
but there's nothing wrong with adding more.
