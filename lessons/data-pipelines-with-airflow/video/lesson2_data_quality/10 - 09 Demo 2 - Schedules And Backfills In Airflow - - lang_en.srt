1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
So, now that we have had a quiz,

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,775
we're going to modify our DAG with a schedule and date and maximum active runs.

3
00:00:05,775 --> 00:00:08,415
Let me go ahead and walk through a demo for you.

4
00:00:08,415 --> 00:00:11,730
So, let me show that lesson one.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,950
Lesson two demo one is off.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,570
Then I'm going to return to my DAGs over

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,590
here and I'm going to open up lesson tow demo two.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:31,390
All right, so we have our DAG here starting on line 35.

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,505
We're going to fill in some information on this DAG.

10
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:38,785
The first thing we're going to do is we're going to give it an end date.

11
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:42,655
So, we're going to give it an end date of December 1st.

12
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:47,805
So, I'm going to say datetime dot datetime 2018,

13
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:55,945
December 1st, and then I'm going to make sure that I say I have zero, zero, zero, zero.

14
00:00:55,945 --> 00:01:00,530
Again, that's hours, minutes, seconds, and microseconds.

15
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,105
Then I'm going to go down and set a schedule interval.

16
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:08,480
So for this schedule interval I'm going to use monthly.

17
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,290
All right. So now we have a monthly schedule interval.

18
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:20,530
Finally, I'm going to give it a max active run setting.

19
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,425
I'm going to cover this in just a second but I just want to reiterate,

20
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:25,640
we have a start date and an end date.

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,559
So what we should see here is that our DAG should run for starting on January 1st,

22
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:36,845
2018, and should conclude on December 1st, 2018.

23
00:01:36,845 --> 00:01:40,565
I've also said that the schedule interval should be monthly,

24
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:43,310
so we should have 12 total runs.

25
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,930
Finally, what is max active runs?

26
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,220
We haven't covered this in the lecture because this is

27
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,950
a particular setting on our schedule.

28
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,920
Max active runs is an argument to

29
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,830
our DAG constructor which tells Airflow that

30
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,085
I only want one of this DAG to run at a time.

31
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:03,830
I'll help you understand this parameter a little

32
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,265
bit more when we actually visualize this as in the run.

33
00:02:07,265 --> 00:02:10,325
Okay. So flip to edit a DAG,

34
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:11,785
just going to take a look through here.

35
00:02:11,785 --> 00:02:14,260
Everything looks good. We have our settings

36
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,950
correct so we've saved and now we're going to open Airflow backup.

37
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,310
So we're going to open lesson two demo three,

38
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,710
pull up the code to make sure that my changes have been reflected.

39
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:31,605
I can see here that we have 2018-2019 except for this is the wrong DAG, sorry about that.

40
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:34,020
Meant to click on lesson two demo two,

41
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,355
so make sure I'm on the right row this time.

42
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:38,440
I'm going to click on the code view,

43
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,270
scroll down a bit here and you can see we have our to-dos filled in here.

44
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,635
So a monthly interval,

45
00:02:44,635 --> 00:02:48,130
December 1st, and max active runs set to 1.

46
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,350
So I'm going to turn to my DAGs menu,

47
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,495
and I turn-on lesson two demo two.

48
00:02:53,495 --> 00:02:56,780
I wait a few moments and refresh the page and

49
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,215
we can see that Airflow has already started to schedule our DAG.

50
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:03,140
Click into our DAG and you can

51
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,855
see here that Airflow has picked up that we have a monthly schedule.

52
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:11,135
So that's correct. We can see that Airflow is actually starting to run our DAGs.

53
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:13,840
So I'm going to refresh the page,

54
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,460
and we have our first monthly run complete.

55
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,200
So this took place on,

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,020
you can see the run up there 2018-01-01,

57
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,335
so this is our run for the 1st of January, 2018.

58
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:26,120
If I refresh the page,

59
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,965
we have our second run happening.

60
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:29,840
I'm going to refresh one more time here.

61
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,150
I want to get these to turn, there we go,

62
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,775
turned gray and then we'll get it to turn green.

63
00:03:34,775 --> 00:03:39,200
Great. So we can see we have a second run here for February 1.

64
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,935
So again, you can see in this black box,

65
00:03:41,935 --> 00:03:44,500
it says run 2018-02-01.

66
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,475
So this is a run for February 1st.

67
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:51,965
So Airflow is currently back-filling the history of all of these runs.

68
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:56,840
Keep refreshing and so what's really interesting about this is that you

69
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,370
can just roll over each one of these to see Airflow working on its back-fill.

70
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,655
So we talked about max active runs.

71
00:04:04,655 --> 00:04:08,435
I come back over here, you can see this variable, max active runs.

72
00:04:08,435 --> 00:04:10,765
What does that mean? What does this do?

73
00:04:10,765 --> 00:04:13,380
So max active runs tells Airflow,

74
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,860
it's okay to parallelize my tasks.

75
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,480
So in this particular case,

76
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,874
we have four tasks,

77
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:22,385
but I don't want you to parallelize runs of my DAGs.

78
00:04:22,385 --> 00:04:28,545
So I don't want the run for say January 1st and February 1st to happen at the same time.

79
00:04:28,545 --> 00:04:33,560
This can be important because some analyses depend on data from the previous month.

80
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,125
So I want my January analysis to complete before my February analysis begins.

81
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,320
Max active runs lets you control that.

82
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,950
If you'd like, there are advanced features for the actual tasks and

83
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,800
operators within your DAG where you can say that you don't want

84
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,100
more than one copy of a particular DAG running at once but

85
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,675
often times this kind of parallelization can really speed up your DAG.

86
00:04:56,675 --> 00:05:02,165
So we're not going to watch the execution of this DAG for too much longer here.

87
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:04,430
I want to see if I can catch an example of it

88
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,755
actually parallelizing the execution of our DAGs.

89
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:08,790
So here you can see the light green,

90
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,470
this is running, okay?

91
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,890
So I can see here that

92
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:17,600
the create trips table and the create stations table tasks are running at the same time.

93
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,410
So we're seeing parallelization of our tasks.

94
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,320
Likewise, I can go to my graph view and I can actually see all of

95
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,330
the runs and the status of

96
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,510
those runs and what's really nice is you can see the date built-in here.

97
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,635
So January 1st, February 1st,

98
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:37,130
March 1st, so on and so forth.
