00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,285
Great question. So, question was,

2
00:00:03,285 --> 00:00:06,060
"Is time the only type of partition?

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,050
Can we partition on other types of things like an event or a value?"

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,675
Absolutely, there are other types of partitioning.

5
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:14,895
We're actually going to talk about that shortly.

6
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:17,760
Specifically, we're going to be talking about

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,610
logical partitioning and also size partitioning or data size partitioning.

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:29,280
You could also partition around events and other types of things, but yes.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,290
Absolutely, time is a common one,

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,050
but it's not the only kind of partitioning. Great question.
