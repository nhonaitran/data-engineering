1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
All right. I hope everyone had fun working on the exercise.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,600
We're going to take a quick look at the solution.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,950
So, let me open it up.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,765
I'm going to go down to my solutions.

5
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:20,145
Lesson two, exercise one. All right.

6
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,949
So, as we take a look at the solution,

7
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,935
we're going to recognize that your code looks a little bit different from mine.

8
00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:28,395
So, we're loading the stations' data,

9
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,495
as well as the trip data.

10
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:33,255
If we go down and take a look at the operators,

11
00:00:33,255 --> 00:00:34,635
we can see just like in mine,

12
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:38,445
you have a create_trips_table, copy_trips_task.

13
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:41,870
The difference is that you don't have a traffic calculation task,

14
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,625
and instead you're loading a stations_table and a copy_stations_task.

15
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:52,520
I asked you to run the DAG without this second line here first.

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,590
Then, to add the second line,

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,795
where we have create_stations_table happen,

18
00:00:56,795 --> 00:00:58,825
and then the copy_stations_task.

19
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,860
With both of those changes in place,

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,140
you were able to see the difference in the runs between both of those decks,

21
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,500
which again you should have ended up with something that looks similar to this.

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,125
However, you would've had creating the stations_table,

23
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,240
and then finishing the stations_table.
