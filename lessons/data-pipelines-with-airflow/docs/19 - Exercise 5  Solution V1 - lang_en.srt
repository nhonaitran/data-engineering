00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,115
All right. Well, I hope you guys had fun working on that exercise.

2
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:08,745
Just to review one more time what we did.

3
00:00:08,744 --> 00:00:13,869
We added a context variable to our code.

4
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:19,664
I gave you guys the opportunity to do whatever you would like,

5
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:22,410
so you could print anything you'd like here,

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,339
as long as you were using keyword arguments based off of

7
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:34,335
the actual information available on Airflow on the website.

8
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:38,370
The other thing you need to do was actually set provide context equal to true.

9
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:44,250
With those two things, you're good to go and execute your DAG,

10
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,340
and actually see the task print out that information.
