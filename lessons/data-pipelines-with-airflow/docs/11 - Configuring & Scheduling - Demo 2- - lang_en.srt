1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,529
Now that we know a little bit more about schedules and Airflow,

2
00:00:02,529 --> 00:00:05,519
we're going to do a quick demo to add a schedule to our DAG.

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,054
So, the first thing I'm going to do,

4
00:00:08,054 --> 00:00:09,750
I'm going to ask you guys to do the same thing

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,609
in the exercise when you perform this if you

6
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:15,404
were using the Airflow UI is to click this on button back to off.

7
00:00:15,404 --> 00:00:19,035
We'll come back to lesson one demo to in a moment.

8
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:21,175
So, the first thing we're going to do,

9
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:24,695
is we're going to open exercise two.

10
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:29,010
So, I'm going to get back to the DAGs for the demos here.

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,945
So, I'm going to open demo two,

12
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:32,799
and all we're going to do,

13
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,394
so this should be pretty much exactly the same as the previous exercise.

14
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:39,790
The only thing we're going to do is add a schedule interval to the DAG,

15
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,765
starting on line 16.

16
00:00:41,765 --> 00:00:45,125
So, I'm going to add a comma at the end of this start date,

17
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:51,480
and then I'm going to say schedule interval equal @monthly.

18
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,410
So, this tells Airflow,

19
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:58,039
hey I want you to run this DAG once a month.

20
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,829
I'm going to go ahead and save,

21
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,750
and that's really all there is to it.

22
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,439
So, the reason that we have this time delta of 30 days,

23
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:09,724
I'm actually going to make this 60 days just so it's a little more entertaining.

24
00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:13,099
The only reason that we're setting it back 60 days is I want you guys to see

25
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:17,649
Airflow backfill for the last month. So, this says.

26
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,140
hey, the start date is right now minus 60 days.

27
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:26,194
So, it's going to be starting some point almost two months ago.

28
00:01:26,194 --> 00:01:29,509
So, I'm going to refresh. I'm going

29
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,094
to make sure that my code was picked up by clicking on "Code View",

30
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:37,280
scroll down here, we can see that picked up my schedule interval at monthly,

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,945
you have a time delta of 60 days.

32
00:01:39,944 --> 00:01:42,389
I'm going to go back to that front page,

33
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,689
and then I'm going to click the "On" button,

34
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,039
and then going to wait a few moments here and then refresh.

35
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:54,304
You'll notice that it's already run our task.

36
00:01:54,305 --> 00:01:57,215
I didn't click the run button. I didn't click this.

37
00:01:57,215 --> 00:02:01,865
The reason that it ran automatically is because we gave Airflow is schedule,

38
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:05,729
so it knows to run our DAGs when it has a schedule.

39
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,875
So you can see here it says @monthly.

40
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,289
Because their start date was 60 days ago,

41
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,060
Airflow thinks it's behind schedule,

42
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,360
that it needs to backfill to the previous month.

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,655
So, now if I refresh this you can see our task is successful,

44
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:20,610
so is our DAG run.
