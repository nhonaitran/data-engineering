00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,965
My name is Ben Goldberg,

2
00:00:01,965 --> 00:00:03,870
and I'll be your instructor for this course.

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,740
Throughout these lessons, I'll be introducing you to the concept of data pipelines,

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,130
and how you can use them to accelerate your career as a data engineer.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,730
This course will focus on applying the data pipeline concepts you learn through

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,885
an open source tool from Airbnb called Apache Airflow.

7
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:20,640
Once you've completed this course,

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,149
you will be ready to apply these skills in your career as a data engineer.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,905
Before we get started, I want to tell you a bit about myself.

10
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:34,424
Most of my career has been centered around data engineering of one kind or another.

11
00:00:34,424 --> 00:00:37,729
I spent the beginning of my career working on computer vision

12
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:41,254
teaching airborne systems to understand and parse the world around them.

13
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:44,150
I worked at an artificial intelligence startup that was able to

14
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:46,909
transform raw datasets into written language,

15
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:48,709
which is where I had my first introduction to

16
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,079
many of the concepts we're going to cover in this course.

17
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,814
I'm currently located in Chicago where I'm a staff engineer at SpotHero.

18
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:56,629
At SpotHero, I founded, built,

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,715
and lead our data engineering team.

20
00:00:58,715 --> 00:01:01,340
I'm also a contributor to Apache Airflow,

21
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,420
and one of the three original contributors to the Airflow Kubernetes executor.

22
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,719
The approaches we're going to cover in this course represents the best practices

23
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:11,810
that I've learned through my day-to-day work as a data engineer,

24
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,109
and through collaborating with colleagues in the space.
