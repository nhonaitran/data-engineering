1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
So what is Apache Cassandra?

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,290
Let's talk about the NoSQL database we'll be

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,110
using for our demos and examples in this course.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,720
Apache Cassandra provides scalability and

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,825
high availability without compromising performance.

6
00:00:12,825 --> 00:00:15,960
Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,020
commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,410
makes it the perfect platform for mission critical-data.

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,605
Apache Cassandra uses its own query language just called CQL or Cassandra Query Language,

10
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:31,630
but it'll feel very similar to SQL.
