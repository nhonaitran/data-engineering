00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610
So let's talk about the relational database we'll be using in

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,105
this course for relational data modeling exercises and demos.

3
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:07,920
What is PostgreSQL?

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,525
The PostgreSQL is an open-source object-relational database system

5
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:15,495
and it uses and builds on the SQL language.

6
00:00:15,495 --> 00:00:19,110
So it uses inbuilt from the SQL database language by providing

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,995
various features that reliably store in scale, complicated data workloads.

8
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:28,665
PostgreSQL syntax is different than other relational database SQL syntax.

9
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:30,630
But this is just a small note.

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,510
All relational and non-relational databases tend to have

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,555
their own SQL syntax and operations you can perform.

12
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:38,955
There are different between types of implementations.

13
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:42,240
Most just need a quick Google Search to understand the difference.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,450
This note is just to make you aware of this.

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,170
Data modeling concepts are what you need to focus on in these lessons,

16
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,940
not so much on the syntax
