1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Before we start diving into Postgres and Apache Cassandra,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,125
let's all get on the same page on what exactly is data modeling.

3
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:10,859
Data modeling at a high level is all about an abstraction

4
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:14,865
that organizes elements of data and how they relate to each other.

5
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:20,130
We are all so used to spreadsheets and the way data is organized in that fashion.

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,765
Who hasn't made a spreadsheet to organize their household bills or plan a trip?

7
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:29,595
Think about the process you went through to create that first set of rows and columns.

8
00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:32,055
That is data modeling.

9
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:36,990
The process of creating data models for an informational system.

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,210
Data modeling can easily translate to database modeling,

11
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,655
as this is the essential end state.

12
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:46,745
Data modeling can be considered an abstract process.

13
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:49,520
But as you continue the process of creating data models,

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,330
you'll begin modeling the data for a particular informational system.

15
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,460
Data modeling can easily be called database modeling,

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,665
as this will be your final state or the home of your data.

17
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:05,269
The process of data modeling is to organize data into a database system to

18
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:10,520
ensure that your data is persisted and easily usable by you in your organization.

19
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,770
Data modeling is a process to support both your business and your user applications.

20
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,310
Let's discuss the difference between these two needs.

21
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,920
Let's say we owned an online store,

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,980
we will need to store that data so that we

23
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,430
can understand how much stock we sold of a particular item.

24
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,560
This is a business process,

25
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,770
and we'll also need to store information about our customer as

26
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,190
they'd log onto our website, a user application.

27
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,880
To begin a data modeling process,

28
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,189
the team must gather requirements from the application team,

29
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:46,820
the business users, and our end users to understand that data must

30
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,885
be retained and served as a business or the end-users.

31
00:01:50,885 --> 00:01:54,170
First we need to map out that our data must be stored and

32
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,815
persisted and how that data will relate to each other.

33
00:01:57,815 --> 00:02:01,490
Next we want to focus on conceptual data modeling.

34
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,340
The process starts or process of doing

35
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,764
actual data modeling starts with conceptual data modeling with entity mapping.

36
00:02:08,764 --> 00:02:13,610
This can be done actually by hand or by using many tools to do this work.

37
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,820
Conceptual data modelings is just as it sounds.

38
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,730
This is mapping the concepts of the data that you have or will have.

39
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,785
Again, think about the Excel spreadsheets you've made in the past.

40
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:28,950
The moment where you jot down some notes and titles to call your columns,

41
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,070
is like conceptual data modeling.

42
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,660
Think of this as a giant white-boarding session with all the members of your team.

43
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,085
The relationship between your data will be organized in this process.

44
00:02:40,085 --> 00:02:42,110
Think about our online store.

45
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,605
We can imagine having a customer box,

46
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:46,285
connected to our sales box,

47
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:48,275
connected to our inventory box.

48
00:02:48,275 --> 00:02:50,180
Here, when I say box,

49
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,920
I'm really referring to something like this,

50
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,500
this is an entity mapping diagram.

51
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,160
Next will be doing logical data modeling.

52
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,850
From their, logical data modeling is done where the contextual models are mapped

53
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:07,025
to logical models using the concept of tables, schemas, and columns.

54
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:10,280
Now we have to start thinking more practically and move

55
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,705
those boxes and arrows we drew it on the whiteboard to tables with columns.

56
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:17,960
Let's think about the box we created for our customer.

57
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,640
Naturally, each customer table will have columns such as name,

58
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,960
address, and phone number.

59
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,279
From there, physical data modeling is done transforming

60
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:34,235
the logical data model to the databases data definition language or DDL,

61
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:36,274
to be able to create the databases,

62
00:03:36,274 --> 00:03:38,240
the tables, and the schemas.

63
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,130
Now we need to start writing code.

64
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:45,815
We will be writing our DDLs to create tables in the way that the database understands.

65
00:03:45,815 --> 00:03:49,760
Every database does this about 99 percent the same,

66
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,745
but always with a few tweaks.

67
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:54,875
You'll need to Google when working with a new database.

68
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,645
So a DDL, again,

69
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:59,815
that definition is the Data Definition Language.

70
00:03:59,815 --> 00:04:03,395
In this course, we're going to focus on the physical data model

71
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:07,700
to create DDLs in relational and non-relational databases.

72
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,580
We're going to focus on combination of

73
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,195
biological and physical data modeling in this class,

74
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:16,780
with both Postgres and Apache Cassandra.
