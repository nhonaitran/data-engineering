1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
So let's wrap up what we learned.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,055
We learned about what is data modeling,

3
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:07,200
who does data modeling,

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,040
when to and not to use relational databases,

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,895
when to and not to use NoSQL databases,

6
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:17,655
how to create a simple table and PostgreSQL,

7
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:20,850
and how to create a simple table in Apache Cassandra.

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,455
Lesson two we'll focus more on how to do data modeling with PostgreSQL.

9
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:30,490
Lesson three we'll focus more on how to do data modeling in Apache Cassandra.
