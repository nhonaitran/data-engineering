1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,255
Let's talk about when to use a relational database.

2
00:00:03,255 --> 00:00:06,540
So next, we will review when to use a relational database,

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,820
and we're going to go over this in the next few slides.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,680
So the advantage of using

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,535
a relational database and we're going to go through quite a few options here.

6
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:17,730
So the first one here is just the ease of use,

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,710
and especially of using SQL.

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,900
The ease of writing queries in SQL,

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,415
it's a very common database query language that is very straightforward.

10
00:00:26,415 --> 00:00:29,250
Next is the ability to do JOINS.

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,384
That's one of the reasons we'd want to use a relational database.

12
00:00:32,384 --> 00:00:34,620
The ability to use JOINS,

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,630
combining more than one table on a common key or to get more information.

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,800
This is something that is unique to relational databases and makes it very powerful.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,130
The ability to do aggregations and analytics,

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,415
the ability to do this on your data,

17
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:51,315
to do the analytics and the aggregations.

18
00:00:51,315 --> 00:00:54,380
This is really what a relational database was built for,

19
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,085
along with being a persistent datastore.

20
00:00:57,085 --> 00:00:59,070
GROUP BY, ORDER BY,

21
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,690
SOME are all examples that we're not going to go into this course,

22
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,165
but they are good examples of aggregations.

23
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,480
If you have smaller data volumes,

24
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,115
then using a relational database is probably a good idea.

25
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:14,180
If you have a smaller data volume, essentially,

26
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,665
if you don't have big data,

27
00:01:15,665 --> 00:01:18,965
you can use a relational database for simplicity.

28
00:01:18,965 --> 00:01:22,310
Next, it's easier to change business requirements.

29
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,820
Relational databases make it easy to change business requirements,

30
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,645
as you can perform ad hoc queries on your database with ease.

31
00:01:29,645 --> 00:01:32,300
Again, you'll have the flexibility to run

32
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,255
many different queries and new queries on your data.

33
00:01:35,255 --> 00:01:37,885
Think of a new query, go try it out,

34
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:39,935
as long as you have permissions, of course.

35
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:43,715
Modeling the data, not modeling queries.

36
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:47,975
With relational databases, you'll be modeling the data itself,

37
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:51,025
not modeling your data to the queries.

38
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:55,520
Data modeling is independent in some regards to your queries,

39
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,670
especially when compared to non-relational databases.

40
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,670
We'll learn more about this later in the next lesson.

41
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,665
You'll also get the added benefit of secondary indexes.

42
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:08,350
So what do we mean by secondary indexes?

43
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,419
Let's review on the next slide.

44
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:15,850
So in this case, another fundamental concept is the idea of secondary indexes.

45
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,395
You would like to efficiently structure your data

46
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:20,920
by an index that is not your primary key.

47
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,965
You can add a secondary index for quick searching.

48
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:27,265
In this example, our primary key is on city.

49
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:30,160
That is what we would normally use in our queries.

50
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,270
Let's say this here. Let's say imagine we normally do our queries using the city,

51
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,465
but we find we're frequently using the country code in our queries.

52
00:02:40,465 --> 00:02:44,385
We can create a secondary index to speed up the retrieval process.

53
00:02:44,385 --> 00:02:48,800
Be aware, secondary indexes require additional resources.

54
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,925
Let's go back to the advantages of using relational databases.

55
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:57,110
Here, maybe the most important one of all is the fact that

56
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,310
relational databases add the ability to have ACID transactions.

57
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,930
The benefit of ACID transactions means that you'll have strong data integrity,

58
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,060
basically that your data is correct.

59
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,320
What do we mean by ACID transactions?

60
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,910
Let's look at this more in depth.
