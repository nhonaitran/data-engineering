1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,065
So let's talk a little bit about relational and NoSQL databases.

2
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:05,600
We've talked about the who,

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,260
the what, and the why of data modeling.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,405
Now let's start focusing on how to do this for each type of database.

5
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:17,415
Relational and non-relational databases do data modeling differently,

6
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:21,180
and by learning about the difference between these two types of databases,

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,815
we will learn why we have to take different approaches to data modeling.

8
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:29,650
So let's first focus on relational databases.

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,995
The relational model.

10
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:36,140
This model organizes data into one or more tables or

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:42,500
relations of columns and rows with a unique key identifying each row.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,340
Generally, each table represents one entity type such as your customer,

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,765
your product, think along those lines.

14
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:52,790
So here we have just an example.

15
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,115
Here is our tuple or row,

16
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:57,445
we have our attribute or column,

17
00:00:57,445 --> 00:01:01,565
and then the whole thing is called a relation or a table.

18
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:03,740
So at a very basic level,

19
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,605
a table is a collection of rows and columns.

20
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:13,055
A relational database is a digital database based on the relational model of data.

21
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:16,010
A software system used to maintain

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:22,805
relational databases is a relational database management system or RDBMS.

23
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:26,360
The relational model and the relational database were invented at

24
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,290
IBM and by Edgar Codd in the late 60's and early 70's.

25
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,805
It is a digital database that is modeled after relational model of data.

26
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:40,475
The software system to maintain a relational database is referred to as an RDBMS.

27
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,170
So just a note here,

28
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,925
you will hear this term a lot.

29
00:01:43,925 --> 00:01:46,220
So become familiar with this acronym,

30
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,955
which again stands for the relational database management system.

31
00:01:50,955 --> 00:01:55,555
So SQL or Structured Query Language is the language used across

32
00:01:55,555 --> 00:02:00,280
almost all relational database system for querying and maintaining the database.

33
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,985
So SQL is a language that you will use to interact with the database.

34
00:02:03,985 --> 00:02:06,640
So some common types of relational databases.

35
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,250
Here I've just listed very few and there's many more,

36
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,050
but here are just some of the highlights.

37
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,030
We have Oracle, Teradata,

38
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,080
MySql, Postgres, which we'll use in this course, and Sqlite.

39
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,910
I've roughly ordered these in order of enterprise production readiness.

40
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,570
Oracle is used by almost every enterprise as their system of

41
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:29,765
truth that handles asset transactions, more on this later.

42
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:33,045
Banking systems etc run on Oracle.

43
00:02:33,045 --> 00:02:36,940
In contrast, Sqlite is a database in file format,

44
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:42,620
and is generally used in development of extremely simple tasks in an application.

45
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,975
So let's continue on the basics.

46
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:49,115
A database, or in some database systems is called a schema,

47
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:51,275
is a collection of tables.

48
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:57,905
A table or a relation is a group of rows sharing the same labeled elements or columns.

49
00:02:57,905 --> 00:03:00,215
So here we have our database and schema,

50
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:02,045
again collection of table,

51
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:06,350
or tables or relation is a group of rows sharing the same labeled elements.

52
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,675
So let's look at our customer table here.

53
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:10,320
So our customer table,

54
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,450
in this case, it's a table,

55
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,980
so it's probably living inside,

56
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,825
being housed in a database.

57
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:16,670
So it has a variety of columns,

58
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,440
name, email, and city.

59
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,465
Then the rows here.

60
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:23,005
We have columns or attributes,

61
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:24,390
which is the labeled elements.

62
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,860
Again, in this case,

63
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,440
our name, email, or city.

64
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,280
Then we have rows and tuples.

65
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,810
So in this example,

66
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,100
it would be a single item.

67
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,965
So it may be the first row in my table, which is Amanda.

68
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:42,850
Then my email, Jane Doe at xyz, and city, NYC.
