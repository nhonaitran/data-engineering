1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,830
So now that we understand what data modeling is,

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,230
let's talk about why data modeling is important.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,695
So data organization is critical.

4
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:16,079
So the organization of your data for your applications is extremely important.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,885
Organizing data determines later data use.

6
00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:23,015
Having a well thought out and organized data model

7
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:26,375
is critical to how that data can later be used.

8
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:30,140
Queries that could have been straightforward and simple might become

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,220
complicated queries if data modeling is not well thought out.

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,485
You don't want to have to do a join on four tables just to get a customer e-mail,

11
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:43,375
when they could have easily added that column to my customer table.

12
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:47,150
That's just a simple example to try to get you thinking about how we want to

13
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,840
make sure our queries are simple and straightforward as much as we can.

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,915
Next, begin prior to building out applications,

15
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:56,555
business models, and analytical models.

16
00:00:56,555 --> 00:01:00,665
So the data modeling process begins prior to building out applications,

17
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:02,765
business logic, and analytical models.

18
00:01:02,765 --> 00:01:05,075
It's definitely an iterative process.

19
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:06,800
So you want to make sure that your starting

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,470
data modeling early with half of your organization,

21
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,440
it's probably not something you can do alone to be successful.

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,695
This is not something you want to leave until the last minute.

23
00:01:15,695 --> 00:01:18,395
Again, it is an iterative process.

24
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:22,520
Having flexibility will help as new information becomes available.

25
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,615
Maybe you'll need to add a column to a table that you had not foreseen.

26
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:29,615
Maybe you want to add a column to your customer table

27
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:33,360
or create a new table that focuses on new customers.
