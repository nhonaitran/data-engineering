00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
We've talked about the what and the why,

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,220
and now let's talk about the who,

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,975
and I don't mean the band.

4
00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:08,850
Who does data modeling?

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,145
Data modeling is an important skill.

6
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:13,065
It's important for data scientists,

7
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:15,675
software engineers, data engineers.

8
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:19,635
Anyone involved in the process of using and analyzing data.

9
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:22,170
So really, everyone.

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,405
If you'll be working with data,

11
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:28,480
you want to have the fundamental of data modeling in your toolkit.
