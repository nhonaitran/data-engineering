00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,905
Hi there. Welcome to Lesson 1,

2
00:00:01,905 --> 00:00:04,065
this is Introduction to Data Modeling.

3
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:07,680
In this lesson, you will understand the strengths and weaknesses of

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,250
different types of relational databases and non-relational databases,

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,955
and the fundamentals of data modeling for both types of databases.

6
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:16,390
My name is Amanda Moran,

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,885
and I will be your instructor for this course.

8
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:21,450
Throughout these lessons, I'll be introducing you to

9
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,060
the concept of data modeling and how you can use

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,340
them to organize your data that can be easily queried and utilized by your organization.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,840
So before we get started,

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,360
I just wanted to tell you a little bit about myself.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,880
I'm a bachelor's in science in biology from

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,980
the University of Washington and a master's in

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,190
computer science and engineering from Santa Clara University.

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,730
I worked as a Software Engineer at HP, SGEN,

17
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,505
Luckheed Martin, and Teradata on three different distributed databases.

18
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:53,165
I'm an Apache committer and I'm on the project management committee

19
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:57,305
for a open source project called Apache travodia.

20
00:00:57,305 --> 00:01:00,210
For data stacks, I'm a Developer Advocate.

21
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,590
Developer Advocate is a Software Engineer that's in the middle layer

22
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,995
between our internal engineering organization and our users,

23
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:09,630
our developers, and our customers
