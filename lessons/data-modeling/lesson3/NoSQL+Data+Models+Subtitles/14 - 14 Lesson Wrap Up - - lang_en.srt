1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,910
All right. So we're ready to wrap up.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,355
We've gone through all our demos and all our exercises.

3
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:07,110
So what did we learn in this lesson?

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,109
We learned about the basics of distributed database design and why

5
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:13,274
the affects of that will affect our data modeling decisions.

6
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:15,750
NoSQL is already optimized for rights.

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,204
So we must model our data to allow reads to be fast.

8
00:00:20,204 --> 00:00:24,104
We must have our queries and model the tables to our queries.

9
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:26,714
Always data model with queries in mind.

10
00:00:26,714 --> 00:00:29,539
Importance of denormalization: We learned why

11
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,509
we must denormalize to allow for fast reads.

12
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:37,134
We learned about Apache Cassandra and how it is a very popular NoSQL database.

13
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:40,969
Then it's also used in a number of very high profile companies.

14
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:42,899
We learned about the primary key,

15
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,259
partition key, and clustering columns.

16
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:49,085
We learned about the primary key and how that is made up of partition key,

17
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:50,509
which distributes the data,

18
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,089
and the clustering column, which orders the data.

19
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,980
We learned about the where clause as we must think about our queries,

20
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:00,159
and that we have limitations on select star.
