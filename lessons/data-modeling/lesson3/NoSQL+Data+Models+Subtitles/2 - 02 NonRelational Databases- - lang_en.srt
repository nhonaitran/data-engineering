1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,084
So, let's just go through some terminology.

2
00:00:02,084 --> 00:00:06,089
NoSQL and non-relational are interchangeable terms.

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,960
So, NoSQL equals not only SQL.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,460
For the rest of this lesson,

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,060
I'll refer to non-relational databases as NoSQL databases.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,295
Historically, this did stand for non-SQL or NoSQL.

7
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:21,990
But as we learned in lesson one,

8
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,484
NoSQL has come to mean not only SQL.

9
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:31,725
As languages like Cassandra query language closely mimics SQL and they're very close.

10
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:37,070
So, let's just do a quick refresher on when to use a NoSQL database.

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,500
So, if you need high availability,

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,899
you have large amounts of data.

13
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:44,524
You need linear scalability.

14
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:46,475
You need low latency,

15
00:00:46,475 --> 00:00:48,410
you need fast reads and writes.

16
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:52,474
For example; if you are going to be using Apache Cassandra,

17
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:57,335
that's a good example of when you would use a NoSQL database is to use Apache Cassandra.

18
00:00:57,335 --> 00:01:01,219
So, let's talk a little bit about what Apache Cassandra actually is.

19
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,920
So, it's an open source NoSQL database.

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,049
You can go download the code right now.

21
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:09,625
It's all open source and you can go download it, check it out.

22
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:14,015
Run it. Whatever you want do contribute to it. We would all love that.

23
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:17,989
It has a masterless architecture and it has high availability.

24
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:19,869
It's linearly scalable.

25
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:24,050
So, like I said Apache Cassandra is an open-source technology that was created

26
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:28,399
at Facebook and became a top-level Apache project in 2010.

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,975
It was created to handle

28
00:01:29,974 --> 00:01:34,069
big data challenges that relational databases were failing to meet.

29
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:37,009
It's a masterless architecture with no single point of

30
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,995
failure which makes it highly available.

31
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:43,820
It has low latency for reads and writes and it's linear scalable.

32
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:48,439
You add more nodes to just a quick note on when I use the term nodes,

33
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,424
we use that a lot in the distributed database world.

34
00:01:51,424 --> 00:01:53,239
But it's really a server.

35
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:56,584
It can mean server or VM or it's just a system.

36
00:01:56,584 --> 00:02:00,259
One single entity of that system whatever that a Docker container,

37
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,100
whatever that system is that's what it means.

38
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:04,919
So, when we say nodes that's what we're referring to.

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,629
So, as you add more nodes to the system,

40
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:09,275
your performance will actually increase

41
00:02:09,275 --> 00:02:12,245
linearly when you're thinking about linear scalability.

42
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:16,765
Apache Cassandra is used at the backend for some of those most popular apps.

43
00:02:16,764 --> 00:02:19,104
Basically, if you take a look at your phone,

44
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:22,069
some of the apps that you use every day,

45
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:23,884
Apache Cassandra is the backend.

46
00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:27,864
So, very popular apps that use Apache Cassandra are Uber,

47
00:02:27,865 --> 00:02:30,365
Netflix, Hulu, and Twitter.

48
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:33,680
Those are just a few. Another example is Apple.

49
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,795
Apple has over a 7,000 node deployment of Apache Cassandra.

50
00:02:38,794 --> 00:02:41,799
Companies like DataStax, Apple,

51
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,365
Twitter and Facebook are all major contributors to the project.

52
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,300
Remember with an open-source project,

53
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,600
anyone is free to contribute.
