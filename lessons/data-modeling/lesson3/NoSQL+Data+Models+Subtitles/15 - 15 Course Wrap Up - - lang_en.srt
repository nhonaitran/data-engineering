00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,174
So let's wrap up our course.

2
00:00:02,174 --> 00:00:05,639
What did we learn in lesson one, two and three?

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:08,669
In lesson one, we learned about the fundamentals of when to use

4
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:12,539
relational databases and when to use a non-relational database.

5
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:15,764
We learned about their strength and their weaknesses.

6
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,435
In lesson two, we learned about the fundamentals

7
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:21,089
of how to do relational database modeling.

8
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:25,094
We focused on normalization and moving data into third normal form.

9
00:00:25,094 --> 00:00:29,669
We also learned about when to denormalize even in relational data modeling.

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,149
We learn when to use fact and dimension tables and how

11
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,159
those come together to create a star schema which is highly used in industry.

12
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:39,859
In lesson three, we learned about the importance of

13
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:42,920
denormalization for NoSQL database modeling.

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,859
We learned that tables must be denormalized as there are no joints in NoSQL databases.

15
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:54,049
We learned about the fundamentals of NoSQL database modeling that focus on queries first.

16
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:56,284
We discussed how to create the primary key

17
00:00:56,284 --> 00:00:58,939
out of the partition key and clustering columns.

18
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:02,179
We talked about the basics of distributed database design to help us

19
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:06,155
understand why data modeling is different from NoSQL database modeling.

20
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:10,340
Remember, the critical thinking skills you employ when you do data modeling is

21
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,930
a skill that is and should be independent of the type of database you're working with.

22
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,490
Once you have these skills,

23
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:19,689
you'll be able to transfer these skills to any database you are working with.

24
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:21,209
The skill is universal,

25
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:23,989
but data models between systems should be carefully

26
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:27,170
reviewed before doing any kind of blind copy paste.

27
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,030
I've really enjoyed creating these lessons and

28
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,415
sharing my understanding of data modeling with you all.

29
00:01:31,415 --> 00:01:34,980
Congrats on finishing this course and thank you.
