1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,745
So just a quick word on CQL.

2
00:00:02,745 --> 00:00:05,730
Cassandra Query Language is the way that we interact with the database.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,955
It's very similar to SQL, except again,

4
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:13,425
no JOIN no GROUP BY and there's not any subqueries,

5
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:18,615
and they're not in CQL and they're not supported by CQL.

6
00:00:18,614 --> 00:00:23,239
In prior years, authentic Cassandra tables were assessed using a protocol called Thrift.

7
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:25,229
But that was very difficult to use and

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,080
hard for users coming from the relational CQL world.

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,359
There are many language drivers,

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,769
majority supported by datastacks to integrate into an application.

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,640
You've seen in lesson one in our demos and the exercises,

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,855
we were we're utilizing the Python driver.

13
00:00:40,854 --> 00:00:44,640
Other popular drivers are Java,

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,884
C sharp, NodeJS, etc.

15
00:00:46,884 --> 00:00:48,229
There's many many out there,

16
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:49,909
and again, they're all open source.

17
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:53,569
So if you have an idea for a new one, submit the code.

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,780
Go for it, go develop it.

19
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:01,060
We'll continue to use the Python driver in the next set of demos and exercises.
