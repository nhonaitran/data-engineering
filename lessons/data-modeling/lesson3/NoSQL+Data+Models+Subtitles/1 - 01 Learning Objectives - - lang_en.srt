00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,009
So, welcome to lesson three,

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:05,054
Data Modeling for Non-relational Databases.

3
00:00:05,054 --> 00:00:08,160
The learning objectives for this lesson are: students will learn

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,564
the fundamentals of data modeling for NoSQL databases,

5
00:00:11,564 --> 00:00:14,969
focusing on the basics of NoSQL database design,

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:20,385
denormalization, primary keys, clustering columns and the WHERE clause.

7
00:00:20,385 --> 00:00:22,280
This is one of my favorite topics.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,070
It's a little bit complicated but it's very rewarding once you have

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,969
a full understanding of how to do data modeling for NoSQL databases.

10
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:31,589
So, let's get started.

11
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:34,539
It's going to be a little complicated but it's going to be fun.
