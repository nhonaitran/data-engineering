1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,714
Now let's move on to clustering columns.

2
00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:05,744
Clustering columns- The PRIMARY KEY is made up of

3
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:09,884
either just the PARTITION KEY or with the addition of CLUSTERING COLUMNS.

4
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:15,554
The CLUSTERING COLUMNS will determine the sort order within a Partition.

5
00:00:15,554 --> 00:00:20,295
The clustering columns will sort the data in sorted descending order.

6
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:25,845
More than one clustering column can be added or like we talked about before, or none.

7
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:27,404
So, in this case,

8
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:32,730
we have a Composite key with it we're partitioning by year,

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,569
and then from there we have a clustering column on artist's name, and album name.

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,965
So, you can see here in this example if I did a select star from that music library,

11
00:00:40,965 --> 00:00:43,600
you can see that I have my year,

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,590
and then my artist's name which is then in alphabetical order in descending order;

13
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,750
E comes before T,

14
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,125
and B comes before M. Then after that,

15
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,899
it's going to sort by album name.

16
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:58,394
So, here you can see again so,

17
00:00:58,395 --> 00:01:00,345
Elvis so Blue Hawaii,

18
00:01:00,344 --> 00:01:02,524
and then we're going to sort the Beatles.

19
00:01:02,524 --> 00:01:04,280
Here we're going to have Rubber Soul,

20
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,180
and then here I just wanted to make sure it was something that came after Rubber Soul,

21
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,630
so I made it not really an album it's called, 'Showing the order'.

22
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:15,030
So, here it's going to be in descending order as you can see.

23
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,299
Then here we'll have the item for the Monkees.

24
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:20,484
From there, the clustering column will sort in sorted order,

25
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:22,944
and how they were added to the primary key.

26
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,984
So, for example, in this example that I just showed,

27
00:01:25,984 --> 00:01:28,174
they will be distributed by the key,

28
00:01:28,174 --> 00:01:32,954
then sorted in descending order by first the artist's name, and then the album name.

29
00:01:32,954 --> 00:01:38,120
So, the primary key is made up of a partition key which in this case is year,

30
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,060
and a clustering column which is the artist's name.

31
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,064
Remember this is just an example.

32
00:01:44,064 --> 00:01:47,465
It might not be unique enough of a value.

33
00:01:47,465 --> 00:01:50,480
Let's say that the artist created two albums in one year.

34
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,340
Then this data model would not hold up.

35
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,170
But just for the sake of this demo,

36
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,864
we're going to assume that it's unique.

37
00:01:55,864 --> 00:01:59,534
So, here we're going to clustering or excuse me,

38
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:01,825
our partition key here which is year,

39
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:04,480
and our clustering column artist's name.
